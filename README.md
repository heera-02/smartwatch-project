Smartwatch Data Analysis Project

Analyzing smartwatch data to uncover patterns in fitness metrics and provide actionable insights for health optimization.

Overview
  This project focuses on analyzing data collected from smartwatch devices to understand the relationship between physical activity, heart rate, and fitness metrics such as calories burned and distance. The objective is to uncover correlations and trends that can guide users to optimize their health and fitness.

Problem Statement
Analyze smartwatch data to:
Identify patterns between activity levels and fitness metrics.
Explore correlations such as heart rate vs. calories burned.
Provide recommendations to improve user health based on insights.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  Handle missing values and duplicates.
  Normalize and encode data for consistent analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Visualize distributions and trends.
  Correlation analysis for key metrics.
  
Feature Engineering:
  Create new features like steps-to-distance ratio.

Predictive Modeling:
  Build regression models to predict calories burned.
  Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  
Actionable Insights:
  Provide practical recommendations for users.

Technologies Used
  Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
  pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
  matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
  scikit-learn for feature scaling and regression modeling.
  Development Environment: Google Colab

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smartwatch-project.git
2. Install Required Libraries
Install all the necessary Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Access the Dataset
Ensure the dataset (smartwatch.csv) is available in your project folder. If itâ€™s hosted online, replace the URL in your code with the dataset's raw link.

4. Run the Notebook
Open the notebook file (Smartwatch_Analysis.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Run all cells to replicate the analysis and visualize results.

Results
Key Findings
Correlation Insights:
  Strong correlation between steps and calories burned.
  Heart rate trends vary significantly based on activity intensity.
Visual Trends:
  Scatter plots show positive relationships between distance, steps, and calories burned.
  Heatmaps highlight significant correlations among numeric variables.
